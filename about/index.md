### Namaste!

I’m Madhur. I love jumping into water. I prefer cooking over restaurants and trees over ACs.

I work at [Sehatvan](http://sehatvan.in), where I manage the retreats, outreach and development. I am on the quest to learn without college education. [This](/pages/now/) is what I’m exactly doing right now. Sometimes I *try* to make [art](/pages/art/).

I have grown up in too many cities and towns to call one my ‘home town’. After high school, I decided not go to a conventional college. Instead, I have been involved in ideas like [learning without degrees](http://swarajuniversity.org), [an un-schooling lab](http://shikshantar.org/innovations-shiksha/creativity-adda/creativity-adda), [diabetes treatment without medicines](http://diabetestrust.in), [a newspaper that makes you feel positive about world](http://theoptimistcitizen.com), [a reality TV show about sustainability](http://sites.ndtv.com/green-champion/), building mud-houses, self-learning music, [a film about places re-imagining higher education](http://enlivenedlearning.com), [storytelling](http://thekahaniproject.org), and [being a Khoji](/being-a-khoji/).  

Life right now is about self-discovery and doing good work - anything that springs from the core belief that a more beautiful world is possible. The adventure is to continue the practice on our beliefs and ideas.

I think true freedom is about taking ownership of everything that comes in way and being owned by nothing.

Here's the parking lot for ideas to work on [these](/pages/ideashed/) someday. Interested? Get in touch.

*Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope.*

*Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith.* 

*Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we must be saved by love.* 

*No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness.*

*― Reinhold Niebuhr*
