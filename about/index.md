Madhur has grown up in too many cities and towns to call one his home. He is still growing up. 'Walking out' of being an academic topper baccha, going to college, he even walked out of a tv reality show. Swaraj U threw him into an adventure to reclaim his learning.  His adventure with Swaraj U, not only changed him but also his family. His dad too left his job, mom turned from homemaker to entrepreneur and now they are making mud houses and experimenting with living close to nature. Jumping out of his creativity fears, his learning journey is into facilitation in education, storytelling and video production. Right now, together with his family he is working on a healing space near Bhopal. (Sehatvan)
