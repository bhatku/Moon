### Namaste!

I’m Madhur. I love jumping into water. I prefer cooking over restaurants and trees over ACs.

I work at [Sehatvan](http://sehatvan.in), where I manage the retreats, outreach and development. I am on the quest to learn without college education. [This](/pages/now/) is what I’m exactly doing right now. Sometimes I *try* to make [art](/pages/art/).

I have grown up in too many cities and towns to call one my ‘home town’. After high school, I decided not go to a conventional college. Instead, I have been involved in ideas like [learning without degrees](http://swarajuniversity.org), [an un-schooling lab](http://shikshantar.org/innovations-shiksha/creativity-adda/creativity-adda), [diabetes treatment without medicines](http://diabetestrust.in), [a newspaper that makes you feel positive about world](http://theoptimistcitizen.com), [a reality TV show about sustainability](http://sites.ndtv.com/green-champion/), building mud-houses, self-learning music, [a film about places re-imagining higher education](http://enlivenedlearning.com), [storytelling](http://thekahaniproject.org), and [being a Khoji](/being-a-khoji/).  

Life right now is about self-discovery and doing good work - anything that springs from the core belief that a more beautiful world is possible. The adventure is to continue the practice on our beliefs and ideas.

I think true freedom is about taking ownership of everything that comes in way and being owned by nothing.

I want to work on [these](/pages/ideashed/) someday. Interested? Get in touch.

//I find these [resources](/pages/resources/) helpful. You may too.
