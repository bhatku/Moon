###Urban Forest Map

A map of all the wonderful and magnificent plants of a city.
Custom Google maps or some other technology. One can easily search for any plant and know where it is. A city as a flora museum. Really cool would be an app like Pok√©mon go where you could find plants and you would get points for it. (the finder's association with a plant would stay for some months and then it would be open for rediscovery)

###Map of musicians

A map of musicians of the locality. Would help to organize jam sessions and equipment sharing
Easy for anybody to learn with people who know the language of music

###Food Literacy 

A fun and short course on health and food literacy for teenagers and college going students. Saving the future generation from lifestyle diseases. Experiential and relevant to their needs.

###Storytelling Wiki
