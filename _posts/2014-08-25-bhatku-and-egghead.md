Bhatku is sitting in his balcony, staring at the sky trying to make out if it will rain. He munches heartily on a big slice of watermelon, careless that he is swallowing even the seeds.
Egghead has a coffee in her hand instead; she is lost in some planet of Hitchhiker’s Guide to Galaxy. 
Bhatku looks at his melon slice and says, ‘Sometimes I feel like I have so many things on my plate that I can’t decide what to eat first.’
Egghead looks up shutting the book around her finger and grabs a choco chip cookie. ‘I can somewhat relate, I have been feeling I have started eating more things than I can finish off.’
Bhatku picks up another slice of melon. ‘Once I was eating omelet that my friend had made. Just at that moment, another friend walked in with a cheesecake. I completely forgot about the omelet. Even though I love the one she makes’
‘That happens all the time. You are always distracted.’
Only the watermelon peel remains. Bhatku looks around for the bowl of chips, which is empty too. ‘I’m hungry. Can I eat you?’
 ‘See! Again. No but really, it’s very important and a common reason for failure inside.’
‘And then, because somebody has always put effort into cooking it or growing it for me. I feel Guilty. I am worried it will hurt them.’
‘It is your choice which of the things you wanna eat first. There has to be some finishing to each, even though it might lose the taste.
‘Does it happen a lot with you too?’
Egghead passes the pack of chocolate chip cookies hiding behind her chair. ‘I think it’s the biggest obstacle. We might feel we’re eating what we like but actually we’re not.’
Bhatku picks two. ‘Why?’
Egghead pulls out cherries from the pocket of her jacket. ‘Because we are just tasting. And it’s easy to taste!’
‘And tasting doesn’t provide nourishment. One feels weak and hungry always. Some tastes also become addictive.’
‘Yep and it does not even develop a taste.’ 
‘I have been living in too many bouquets. I should move to the kitchen now. Cook myself.’
‘Or maybe move to a staple diet for some time.’
‘You know I always fail at ordering in restaurants. I just keep reading the menu.’
Egghead smiles. ‘You do too?’
‘I know you. You just pass away the Menu.’
‘Hey! I do decide sometimes!’
‘And ice cream is worse. So many flavors and mixes. I think wine tasting is even funnier. Those people have to spit it out.’
Egghead sucks on to the cherries. ‘How long will we just keep tasting and looking for the next dish? We need to eat to nourish ourselves.’
‘And develop a great taste!’
‘Novelty has us addicted. Can’t we slow down and enjoy every flavor? 
‘And not everyone has enough to eat. What about them?’
Egghead stares at the seed of cherry; the flesh around sucked off.
Bhatku looks away. It has started to drizzle.

_An incident Bhatku narrated to me, about food for body and soul. Or for tongue?
