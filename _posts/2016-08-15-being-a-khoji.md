## KHOJI ? ##

__किसी ने कहा की खोजी तो कुत्ता होवे, किसी ने कहा आप सब घूमे हुये मगज के हैं।__

A khoji is not a title, it is not a race of people, neither is it an endangered species of birds. It’s not an honor and it is not an award. It’s not something you can win or lose.
There are seeds from which the forest inside us springs. Often under the layers of conditioning, it is hard to recognize the different seeds. You cant define the forest but you know it. Much can come between it’s flourishing. Only if you look carefully can you nurture it. That is being a khoji.
It is about seeing the brighter corners and the darker ones from whom you have been hiding. It is about filling up your creative confidence back. It is about being vulnerable. It is about breaking our conditioning with a hammer. It about knowing how is the world around and how it drives us. More than that, it is about seeing the world as a story; a mixture of stories. It is about all of us becoming the storytellers. It is about changing the old stories that no longer work for us. It is about learning and living everywhere, I go.
It is a spiritual journey, not of ‘waking up and detaching’ but ‘waking up and engaging’ that is why it something one must undertake at youth and is not something that people do after retirement.
