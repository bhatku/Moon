So you learnt to walk. The next thing you will be taught is to climb stairs. That’s the practice. Because then on, you’ll spend your life climbing stairs and ladders. Grades ladder, career ladder, political ladder, social ladder, religious ladder, spiritual ladder and all other kinds of ladders that man can invent. Maybe you played snakes and ladders. That is how life is.

Is that really true?

Nature doesn’t have any ladders. Nature has hills and mountains. But it also has valleys, rivers and the ocean. And neither of them is expendable. Even people who live at top of the mountain have to come down. You can’t escape to the top of the mountain forever.

And if your ‘value’ changes as you climb up or down. Then ‘your value’ was actually value of the ladder or the mountain.

What happens if you climb down the peak?

What if you meet the river or the sea?
